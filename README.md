This was created in a few hours so its pretty bare bones at the moment, with more time I would add some more style.
Basically its a simple app centered around the Project table, which is parent to the ProjectHistory table.
Users who are signed in can create Project History entries that are displayed underneath the Project description.
A sample conversation can be added if you run rails db:seeds
